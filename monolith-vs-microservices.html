    <h1>Monolith vs Microservices for Early Teams</h1>
    <p class="muted mb-0">
      This is a practical guide for founders and small teams. It is not ideology.
      It explains when microservices help, when they hurt, and what to do instead.

      <h2 class="h5 mb-2">The blunt answer</h2>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Early teams usually want microservices because they feel scalable.
        What they get instead is coordination overhead, deployment complexity, and slower iteration.
        If your team is small, a well structured monolith is usually the fastest path to product maturity.

      <h2 class="h5 mb-2">Why microservices slow early teams down</h2>
      <p class="muted mb-2">This is Brook’s Law applied to architecture.</p>
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li><strong>Coordination explodes:</strong> boundaries create new meetings and new handoffs.</li>
        <li><strong>Interfaces freeze too early:</strong> you lock decisions before you understand the domain.</li>
        <li><strong>Debugging cost rises:</strong> one bug becomes multiple logs and multiple deployments.</li>
        <li><strong>Data becomes harder:</strong> joins turn into event choreography and eventual consistency.</li>

  <div class="mini-card mt-4">
    <div class="mini-card-body">
      <h2 class="h5 mb-2">The better default for early teams</h2>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Start with a modular monolith. Treat it like microservices inside a single deployable unit.
        When domain boundaries become stable and teams need independent deployment, then extract services.
