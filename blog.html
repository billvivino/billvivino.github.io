        <h2>Brewing a Better Beer‑Lovers App: A Behind‑the‑Scenes Tour</h2>
        <small class="date">April&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2025</small>
        <a href="posts/2025-04-21-brewing-a-better-beer-app.html" class="ms-2">Permalink</a>

        <p>
          If you’ve followed our journey, you know we set out to create a place
          where craft‑beer fans can share pours, swap notes, and keep track of
          their personal bottle collections. Over the past few months we’ve
          shipped dozens of updates—big and small—that push us closer to that
          vision. Here’s a peek at the highlights, told in plain English (no
          code required!).
        </p>

        <h3>1. A Feed That Feels Alive</h3>
        <p>
          The home feed is the heart of the app, so we focused first on making
          posting and reacting effortless—and fun: one‑tap photo &amp;
          tasting‑note posts, animated emoji “pours” with a crisp can‑opening
          sound, plus lightning‑fast search and tag suggestions.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Your Personal “Cellar”</h3>
        <p>
          Collectors begged for an easy way to remember what’s aging in the back
          of the fridge. The Cellar tab lets you add beers in seconds, sort by
          style or “drink‑by” reminders, and shows each bottle on a slick rack
          graphic.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Smoother Onboarding</h3>
        <p>
          Early testers on small phones couldn’t see the Sign‑Up button—now the
          screen scrolls naturally on any device and signup steps dropped from
          four to two.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Night‑Friendly Dark Mode</h3>
        <p>
          Blue links on black were unreadable in bars. We reworked the palette
          for sharper contrast so everything stays legible, even on
          low‑brightness Night Shift screens.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Notifications That Land in the Right Place</h3>
        <p>
          Tapping a “Bill commented” alert now jumps straight to that
          conversation—no more random detours.
        </p>

        <h3>6. In‑App Messaging, Refreshed</h3>
        <p>
          Messages once required a force‑quit to refresh. A new swipe‑to‑refresh
          action and smarter caching keep chats live.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Under‑the‑Hood Tune‑Ups</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Faster load times after reorganizing our database</li>
          <li>Profile‑photo updates propagate everywhere automatically</li>
          <li>Weeks of multi‑device testing for rock‑solid reliability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. What’s Next?</h3>
        <p>
          We’re polishing a tipping feature so you can buy digital rounds for
          helpful beer experts. Stay tuned for curated pub feeds and even more
          cellar tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          Craft beer is best enjoyed with friends, and building this app is no
          different. Huge thanks to everyone who posted notes, squashed bugs, or
          just told us the contrast was off at 2 a.m. Cheers! 🍻

        <h2>Building NASA’s WeatherSats AR App</h2>
        <small class="date">April&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2025</small>
        <a href="posts/2025-04-20-nasa-weathersats-ar.html" class="ms-2">Permalink</a>

        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <p>
          In 2022 I joined NASA’s WeatherSats AR project when the app was
          roughly halfway complete.
        </p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>
          My first responsibility was to ensure the satellite AR models
          functioned correctly within the application. I also implemented
          several user‑interface updates to improve the overall experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Stabilising the Codebase</h3>
        <p>
          The build I inherited contained numerous bugs. I spent significant
          time tracing issues—especially in the scene‑loader logic—and fixing
          defects to make the app production‑ready.
        </p>

        <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
        <p>
          WeatherSats AR is built in Unity and written in C#. Unity’s
          cross‑platform workflow let us target both iOS and Android from the
          same project.
        </p>

        <h3>What Came Next</h3>
        <p>
          Since that engagement I’ve taken on additional Unity contracts,
          working on AR experiences and video‑game projects that required custom
          algorithm work. I enjoy creating cross‑platform apps in Unity and look
          forward to future challenges.

        <h2>
          Meet Bill Vivino: Your Experienced Software Developer for Mobile,
          Unity, and More
        </h2>
        <small class="date">April&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2025</small>
        <a href="posts/2025-04-18-meet-bill-vivino.html" class="ms-2">Permalink</a>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Bill Vivino, and I'd like to help you develop your
          project from its initial ideas to completion. With extensive
          experience in Unity, mobile development, and API integrations, I'm
          here to turn your vision into reality.
        </p>

        <h3>My Professional Journey</h3>
        <p>
          I currently work as a contract Unity and C# developer on an
          interactive app for the NASA Visitor Center. Additionally, I
          co-founded an iOS game startup with one of my clients, debuting our
          first app on the App Store. Beyond these roles, I maintain several
          freelance engagements, developing high-quality mobile applications
          tailored to the needs of small-sized businesses.
        </p>

        <h3>Educational Background</h3>
        <p>
          I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Rutgers
          University. I recently began my journey as a freelance contract
          software developer, driven by a renewed passion for creating impactful
          digital experiences.
        </p>

        <h3>Recent Projects and Experience</h3>
        <p>
          My comeback journey started by developing an app tailored specifically
          for craft beer enthusiasts. I then successfully ported a Unity-based
          Lego game from PC to iOS. These initial projects opened doors, leading
          me to collaborate with multiple clients on Upwork, expanding my
          portfolio, and refining my skills further.
        </p>

        <p>
          My substantial experience in Unity/C# game development, combined with
          extensive iOS app development skills, directly contributed to my
          current role working with AMC NASA. I'm continuously seeking
          opportunities to expand my horizons and deliver high-quality solutions
          tailored to my clients' needs.
        </p>

        <h3>My Skills and Expertise</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I've gained significant experience working with
          popular APIs and frameworks, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>SwiftUI & UIKit:</strong> Crafting intuitive, responsive,
            and beautiful user interfaces for iOS apps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Firebase SDK:</strong> Implementing secure, scalable backend
            solutions for mobile apps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>StoreKit API:</strong> Navigating Apple's complex purchasing
            processes and in-app transactions seamlessly.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Additionally, I have extensive firsthand experience guiding apps
          through Apple's rigorous App Store review process. My expertise
          ensures your apps smoothly transition from beta (using Apple's
          TestFlight) into live production in a timely and efficient manner.
        </p>

        <h3>Let's Work Together</h3>
        <p>
          I'm committed to helping your project succeed and would love the
          opportunity to learn more about your goals. Please feel free to
          explore my <a href="portfolio.html">app portfolio</a> for links to
          completed projects on the App Store and beta versions available via
          TestFlight.
        </p>

        <p>

          <strong>free 30-minute Zoom call</strong> to discuss how I can assist
          you in achieving your vision.
