          I work with non-technical startup founders using Cursor, Replit, or
          Windsurf to co-develop software. By reviewing, editing, and validating
          their changes in real-time—then syncing those updates back into the
          repo—I keep momentum high and timelines short. It’s like pair
          programming across a skill gap.

        <h2>How Much Does It Cost to Make an App?</h2>
        <small class="date">April&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2025</small>
        <a
          href="posts/2025-04-23-how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app.html"
          class="ms-2"
          >Permalink</a
        >

        <h3>So, How Much Does It Actually Cost?</h3>
        <p>
          One critical question I encourage my clients to think about is the
          long-term vision. Many people imagine app development as a fixed-cost,
          one-time event—like purchasing a piece of machinery. You pay once, and
          you’re done. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite work that way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think about your competition. You’re up against industry giants like
          Meta, TikTok, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter). These companies
          employ hundreds—or even thousands—of the most talented people
          full-time, year-round, continually refining and improving their
          platforms. They spend millions annually just maintaining their apps,
          innovating new features, and keeping users engaged.
        </p>

        <h3>“But Bill, I Don’t Have That Kind of Money!”</h3>
        <p>
          You’re right—you probably don’t have a multi-million dollar budget.
          But you might someday, provided you plan strategically. Here are three
          essential considerations to help you think about your app development
          journey:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>MVP Budget:</strong> What’s the feasible initial investment
            you can make to bring a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to market?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Burn Rate:</strong> Understand how long you can financially
            sustain your project without immediate profit. Typically, initial
            funding comes from personal savings or another income source.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lead Generation:</strong> Identify your strategy for
            attracting initial users, customers, and potential investors once
            your MVP launches.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Realistically, What Will an MVP Cost?</h3>
        <p>As cliché as it sounds, the honest answer is: “It depends.”</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Complex, Cutting-edge Technology:</strong> If your app uses
            experimental technologies like AI, AR, or blockchain, expect higher
            development costs. However, the potential upside is also
            significantly greater.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Media or Content-Heavy Apps:</strong> If you’re
            envisioning the next viral social app, know that beyond a
            beautifully designed user interface, you’ll also need a powerful
            backend to handle massive amounts of media content quickly and
            reliably. Storage and cloud computing costs become significant
            factors here.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Video Games:</strong> Planning a video game? Consider the
            considerable investment in visual art, animations, music, character
            development, and game physics. Skilled digital artists and
            developers are essential.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>MVP Cost Breakdown</h3>
        <p>
          Typically, the most basic MVP apps begin around the $5,000–$10,000
          range. However, the realistic range for a robust MVP tends to be
          closer to $25,000–$50,000.
        </p>

        <h3>
          “Wait, Why Does It Cost So Much? Are Developers Ripping Us Off?”
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not at all. App development is costly primarily due to the extensive
          human expertise and hours required. The polished apps you see today
          seem effortless but involve tremendous engineering skill, creativity,
          planning, testing, and ongoing refinement.
        </p>

        <h3>Can’t AI Just Build It for Me?</h3>
        <p>
          I’ve recently had multiple clients who’ve relied on AI-powered
          “no-code” or “low-code” solutions and ended up needing substantial
          additional development support. AI tools, while promising, currently
          only excel at generating baseline code, initial designs, or
          suggestions for troubleshooting and new features. They often fall
          short when building complex, customized apps from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>
          This doesn’t mean AI has no place—quite the opposite. We frequently
          use AI during development to enhance productivity, generate ideas, and
          streamline debugging. Still, human creativity, judgment, and
          experience remain indispensable.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          When budgeting your app development project, think long-term, be
          realistic about initial costs, and plan for ongoing investments.
          Whether you’re developing a simple productivity app or aiming for a
          social media breakthrough, careful budgeting and clear strategies for
          development, launch, and growth are key.

        <h2>Brewing a Better Beer‑Lovers App: A Behind‑the‑Scenes Tour</h2>
        <small class="date">April&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2025</small>
        <a href="posts/2025-04-21-brewing-a-better-beer-app.html" class="ms-2"
          >Permalink</a
        >

        <p>
          If you’ve followed our journey, you know we set out to create a place
          where craft‑beer fans can share pours, swap notes, and keep track of
          their personal bottle collections. Over the past few months we’ve
          shipped dozens of updates—big and small—that push us closer to that
          vision. Here’s a peek at the highlights, told in plain English (no
          code required!).
        </p>

        <h3>1. A Feed That Feels Alive</h3>
        <p>
          The home feed is the heart of the app, so we focused first on making
          posting and reacting effortless—and fun: one‑tap photo &amp;
          tasting‑note posts, animated emoji “pours” with a crisp can‑opening
          sound, plus lightning‑fast search and tag suggestions.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Your Personal “Cellar”</h3>
        <p>
          Collectors begged for an easy way to remember what’s aging in the back
          of the fridge. The Cellar tab lets you add beers in seconds, sort by
          style or “drink‑by” reminders, and shows each bottle on a slick rack
          graphic.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Smoother Onboarding</h3>
        <p>
          Early testers on small phones couldn’t see the Sign‑Up button—now the
          screen scrolls naturally on any device and signup steps dropped from
          four to two.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Night‑Friendly Dark Mode</h3>
        <p>
          Blue links on black were unreadable in bars. We reworked the palette
          for sharper contrast so everything stays legible, even on
          low‑brightness Night Shift screens.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Notifications That Land in the Right Place</h3>
        <p>
          Tapping a “Bill commented” alert now jumps straight to that
          conversation—no more random detours.
        </p>

        <h3>6. In‑App Messaging, Refreshed</h3>
        <p>
          Messages once required a force‑quit to refresh. A new swipe‑to‑refresh
          action and smarter caching keep chats live.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Under‑the‑Hood Tune‑Ups</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Faster load times after reorganizing our database</li>
          <li>Profile‑photo updates propagate everywhere automatically</li>
          <li>Weeks of multi‑device testing for rock‑solid reliability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. What’s Next?</h3>
        <p>
          We’re polishing a tipping feature so you can buy digital rounds for
          helpful beer experts. Stay tuned for curated pub feeds and even more
          cellar tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          Craft beer is best enjoyed with friends, and building this app is no
          different. Huge thanks to everyone who posted notes, squashed bugs, or
          just told us the contrast was off at 2 a.m. Cheers! 🍻

        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <p>
          In 2022 I joined NASA’s WeatherSats AR project when the app was
          roughly halfway complete.
        </p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>
          My first responsibility was to ensure the satellite AR models
          functioned correctly within the application. I also implemented
          several user‑interface updates to improve the overall experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Stabilising the Codebase</h3>
        <p>
          The build I inherited contained numerous bugs. I spent significant
          time tracing issues—especially in the scene‑loader logic—and fixing
          defects to make the app production‑ready.
        </p>

        <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
        <p>
          WeatherSats AR is built in Unity and written in C#. Unity’s
          cross‑platform workflow let us target both iOS and Android from the
          same project.
        </p>

        <h3>What Came Next</h3>
        <p>
          Since that engagement I’ve taken on additional Unity contracts,
          working on AR experiences and video‑game projects that required custom
          algorithm work. I enjoy creating cross‑platform apps in Unity and look
          forward to future challenges.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Bill Vivino, and I'd like to help you develop your
          project from its initial ideas to completion. With extensive
          experience in Unity, mobile development, and API integrations, I'm
          here to turn your vision into reality.
        </p>

        <h3>My Professional Journey</h3>
        <p>
          I currently work as a contract Unity and C# developer on an
          interactive app for the NASA Visitor Center. Additionally, I
          co-founded an iOS game startup with one of my clients, debuting our
          first app on the App Store. Beyond these roles, I maintain several
          freelance engagements, developing high-quality mobile applications
          tailored to the needs of small-sized businesses.
        </p>

        <h3>Educational Background</h3>
        <p>
          I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Rutgers
          University. I recently began my journey as a freelance contract
          software developer, driven by a renewed passion for creating impactful
          digital experiences.
        </p>

        <h3>Recent Projects and Experience</h3>
        <p>
          My comeback journey started by developing an app tailored specifically
          for craft beer enthusiasts. I then successfully ported a Unity-based
          Lego game from PC to iOS. These initial projects opened doors, leading
          me to collaborate with multiple clients on Upwork, expanding my
          portfolio, and refining my skills further.
        </p>

        <p>
          My substantial experience in Unity/C# game development, combined with
          extensive iOS app development skills, directly contributed to my
          current role working with AMC NASA. I'm continuously seeking
          opportunities to expand my horizons and deliver high-quality solutions
          tailored to my clients' needs.
        </p>
