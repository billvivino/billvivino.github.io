          Meet Bill Vivino: Your Experienced Software Developer for Mobile, Unity,
          and More
        </h2>
        <p><em>Published: April 18, 2025</em></p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Bill Vivino, and I'd like to help you develop your
          project from its initial ideas to completion. With extensive
          experience in Unity, mobile development, and API integrations, I'm here
          to turn your vision into reality.
        </p>

        <h3>My Professional Journey</h3>
        <p>
          I currently work as a contract Unity and C# developer on an
          interactive app for the NASA Visitor Center. Additionally, I
          co-founded an iOS game startup with one of my clients, debuting our
          first app on the App Store. Beyond these roles, I maintain several
          freelance engagements, developing high-quality mobile applications
          tailored to the needs of small-sized businesses.
        </p>

        <h3>Educational Background</h3>
        <p>
          I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Rutgers
          University. I recently began my journey as a freelance contract software developer,
          driven by a renewed passion for creating impactful digital
          experiences.
        </p>

        <h3>Recent Projects and Experience</h3>
        <p>
          My comeback journey started by developing an app tailored specifically
          for craft beer enthusiasts. I then successfully ported a Unity-based
          Lego game from PC to iOS. These initial projects opened doors, leading
          me to collaborate with multiple clients on Upwork, expanding my
          portfolio, and refining my skills further.
        </p>

        <p>
          My substantial experience in Unity/C# game development, combined with
          extensive iOS app development skills, directly contributed to my
          current role working with AMC NASA. I'm continuously seeking
          opportunities to expand my horizons and deliver high-quality solutions
          tailored to my clients' needs.
        </p>

        <h3>My Skills and Expertise</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I've gained significant experience working with
          popular APIs and frameworks, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>SwiftUI & UIKit:</strong> Crafting intuitive, responsive,
            and beautiful user interfaces for iOS apps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Firebase SDK:</strong> Implementing secure, scalable backend
            solutions for mobile apps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>StoreKit API:</strong> Navigating Apple's complex purchasing
            processes and in-app transactions seamlessly.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Additionally, I have extensive firsthand experience guiding apps
          through Apple's rigorous App Store review process. My expertise
          ensures your apps smoothly transition from beta (using Apple's
          TestFlight) into live production in a timely and efficient manner.
        </p>

        <h3>Let's Work Together</h3>
        <p>
          I'm committed to helping your project succeed and would love the
          opportunity to learn more about your goals. Please feel free to
          explore my <a href="portfolio.html">app portfolio</a> for links to
          completed projects on the App Store and beta versions available via
          TestFlight.
        </p>

          <strong>free 30-minute Zoom call</strong> to discuss how I can assist
          you in achieving your vision.

        <h2>Behind the Build: NASA WeatherSats AR</h2>
        <p><em>Published: April 20, 2025</em></p>
      
        <p>Back in 2022 I received one of those dream e‑mails: NASA’s Visitor Center
        wanted help turning their WeatherSats educational exhibit into an
        augmented‑reality app. They needed someone who could translate
        flight‑hardware CAD models into smooth, cross‑platform mobile
        experiences—and do it fast.</p>
      
        <p>I jumped in as the project’s contract Unity developer. My first task was
        to wrangle huge, high‑detail satellite models into smartphone‑friendly
        assets. That meant aggressive mesh optimisation, custom shaders for
        solar‑panel glare, and an animation pipeline that could show everything
        from orbital deployment to instrument calibration without melting a GPU.</p>
      
        <p>Once performance was locked, the fun began: building interactive
        timelines and data overlays so students could <strong>walk around a virtual
        GOES satellite, tap a sensor, and see live weather imagery stream onto
        the screen</strong>—all inside their school’s gym or their own backyard.</p>
      
        <p>Unity’s cross‑platform tool‑set let us ship to <strong>iOS, Android, and a
        kiosk‑grade Windows build</strong> from the same project. The result? A
        pocket‑sized museum piece that now accompanies NASA outreach teams across
        the country.</p>
      
        <p>I still get a kick out of watching kids orbit an AR satellite in the
        exhibit hall, forget it’s virtual, and ask, “How did NASA fit that in
        here?”</p>
      
        <p><strong>Have an AR or 3‑D project you need to land?</strong> Let’s talk. Whether it’s
        aerospace visualisation, interactive training, or a marketing demo, I
        can help you bring complex concepts to life on the devices your
        audience already owns.</p>
