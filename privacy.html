      <p><em>Last updated: April 15, 2025</em></p>

      <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes what personal information we collect on our website, how we use it, and how you can control that information. Our aim is to be transparent and give you control over your data. By using our site or submitting information, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We only collect personal information that you choose to give us through
        our contact forms. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> so we know what to call you.</li>
        <li><strong>Email address:</strong> so we can reply to you.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Phone number:</strong> if you want us to call or text you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Country:</strong> to understand where you are contacting us
          from.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you send us a message through our forms, you may also provide
        additional information in the message itself, which we will receive
        along with the above details.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use the information you provide only for the purposes described
        below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To respond to your inquiries or requests and provide the information
          or assistance you asked for.
        </li>
        <li>
          To improve our website, services, and customer support based on the
          inquiries and feedback we receive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will not use your personal information for any purposes other than
        the above without your consent. In particular, we will not send you
        marketing emails or newsletters unless you have explicitly signed up for
        them.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        We do not use any cookies or tracking technologies on our website to
        collect your personal data. The only third-party tool we use is Google
        Tag Manager, which helps us manage website code and monitor basic site
        performance. Importantly, Google Tag Manager does not collect any
        personal information about you. We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook
        Pixel, or any other analytics or advertising trackers. Because we do not
        track our visitors across third-party sites, our website does not
        respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals. In short, when you visit our
        site, we are not storing cookies on your device or tracking you beyond
        your visit to our site.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We respect your privacy and we will not share your personal information
        with third parties. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal
        information to anyone. The details you submit through our contact form
        are used only by us to assist you. We do not disclose your information
        to any third-party companies or individuals, except if required to do so
        by law (for example, if a law enforcement agency legally requires us to
        share certain information). Essentially, your information stays with us
        and is used only for its intended purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take precautions to protect your personal information. Our website is
        secured with standard security measures (such as HTTPS encryption) to
        ensure that the details you send us are protected during transmission.
        We also maintain safeguards to protect the information once we receive
        it, and we continuously work to keep our systems updated and secure.
        However, please understand that no method of transmission over the
        internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, but we strive to use
        commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We will keep your personal information only for as long as necessary to
        fulfill the purpose you provided it for (for example, to respond to your
        inquiry) and for our legitimate business or legal requirements. Once we
        no longer need your information, we will delete it or anonymize it so
        that it no longer identifies you. If you would like us to remove your
        information from our records sooner, you have the right to make that
        request (see the "Your Rights and Choices" section below), and we will
        honor it.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>
        You are in control of the personal information you share with us. If you
        have submitted a contact form, you can request at any time to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Access</strong> the personal information we have about you (if
          any).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Update or Correct</strong> your information if you believe it
          is out-of-date or inaccurate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delete</strong> the information you have given us, so it is
          removed from our records.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To make any of these requests, simply reach out to us using the contact
        information below. We will be happy to assist you and will respond as
        soon as possible. There is no charge for these requests.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our website and services are not directed to children under the age of
        13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under
        13 years old. If you are under 13, please do not provide any personal
        information to us. In the event that we learn we have collected personal
        information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take
        steps to delete that information promptly. If you are a parent or
        guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal
        information, please contact us so we can remove it.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
        in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
        If we make significant changes, we will let you know by posting a
        prominent notice on our website or by other means. The "Last updated"
        date at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last
        revised. We encourage you to review this policy whenever you visit our
        site to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
      <p>

        you wish to request access, correction, or deletion of your personal
