      <h1 class="mb-1">Building NASA’s WeatherSats AR App</h1>
      <small class="text-muted">April&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2025</small>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Project Background</h3>
      <p>
        In 2022 I joined NASA’s <em>WeatherSats AR</em> project when the app was
        roughly halfway complete. The goal: give visitors an immersive way to
        explore Earth‑observing satellites through augmented reality.
      </p>

      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>
        My first responsibility was to ensure the satellite AR models rendered
        and animated correctly across both iOS and Android. I also implemented
        several UI updates—improving touch gestures, information panels, and
        overall usability.
      </p>

      <h3>Stabilising the Codebase</h3>
      <p>
        The build I inherited contained numerous bugs. I spent significant time
        tracing issues— especially in the scene‑loader logic—and fixing defects
        to make the app production‑ready. Memory leaks, incorrect prefab
        references, and broken asset‑bundle links were all resolved.
      </p>

      <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Unity 2021 LTS</strong> with C# scripts drives the entire
        experience. Unity’s cross‑platform workflow let us target iOS and
        Android from the same project, and the <em>AR Foundation</em> package
        provided a single API layer over ARKit and ARCore.
      </p>

      <h3>What Came Next</h3>
      <p>
        Since that engagement I’ve taken on additional Unity contracts, working
        on AR experiences and video‑game projects that required custom algorithm
        work. I enjoy creating cross‑platform apps in Unity and look forward to
        future challenges.
