      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        A troubling trend I see nowadays with people I work with is this
        constant push to pass the buck. I'm willing to bet that Zuck, Altman,
        Nadella, and the other people pushing AI don't like what I'm about to
        say. And I don't care. I can't tell, but part of the snake oil people
        push around is that you can take your hands off the code. The machine
        will do it for you. It's like copying and pasting code snippets and
        examples from Stack Overflow. UI libraries that people stop maintaining
        and break. Maybe we can call this the "old AI."
      </p>
      <h2>The Hands‚ÄëOff Coding Myth</h2>
      <p>
        I get code from clients who say, "Oh yeah, I just copied this Facebook
        Messenger example. Let me get you that code." My first response is
        always, "No‚ÄîI don't want to see that code. That isn't even how I work."
        Why? My approach is to build things carefully from the ground up, get
        involved personally, understand each element piece by piece, and
        methodically ensure each component works ideally before moving on.
      </p>
      <h2>Marie Kondo Your Codebase</h2>
      <p>
        Never pile stuff you don't understand on top of more things you don't
        understand. Because if you think you're going to skip fundamentally
        getting involved, guess what you'll get? You'll get broken code that's a
        complete mess where you don't know your (three-letter word for donkey)
        from your elbow. Let's return to an even more straightforward analogy:
        cleaning your room, Marie Kondo style. How are you going to clean your
        room without getting involved? You must get involved in every decision
        personally‚Äîdo we keep or toss this item? What's the best way to get
        organized? Simplify, simplify, simplify. Discard, discard, discard. I
        had a friend for whom I felt genuinely bad. She could never get her
        apartment clean. Why? Her parents constantly dumped old stuff from their
        storage unit into her living room. Throw that stuff out! It was old
        stuff she no longer needed, making her life harder. Do you think AI is
        going to help you do that? I've seen duplicated views, redundant view
        models, extraneous logic, and "cool new features" generated by AI that
        confuse, break, and gum up the project. AI can easily slow you down if
        you don't have a human engineer managing and taming it every step of the
        way.
      </p>
      <h2>Why AI Won‚Äôt Replace Engineers</h2>
      <p>
        I know‚Äîyou don't want to pay. You don't want to hire engineers. You want
        AI to take care of it for you for free. You want to do it all yourself
        because Cursor paints the seductive illusion that you can. Big tech CEOs
        confidently say that half their code will be AI-generated within a year.
        But here's the snake oil they're selling you: AI isn't managing the
        code. Sure, it can spit out quick boilerplate and sketches. Still, when
        it comes to performing the Marie Kondo on your codebase‚Äîgetting it
        running like a finely-tuned piece of cutting-edge machinery‚Äîthat's the
        brilliant human engineer's job. That's the one who sees everything,
        understands the context, and cleanses the garbage. I'm betting my money
        (and my business) that it'll be long before you can replace that
        engineer. Now that AI is pumping out more code, you might even need more
        engineers than before. Don't get me wrong‚Äîafter I threw down all my
        thoughts, AI polished this article, and Grammarly AI proofread it. AI
        has its place. But the ideas, strategic organization, pruning, and
        discarding extraneous and wasteful elements are all mine. And I don't
        see how that will ever go away. "Okay, got it‚ÄîI'll use AI to write the
        code and be that Marie Kondo manager." No, you have no computer science
        degree. AI will mess up your code in ways you don't understand. You
        won't know why you can't use a Firebase ID macro as an
        identifiable/hashable value on your messages at runtime because you have
        to set its default value in code (it's optional) and retrieve the actual
        value in a fetch, causing navigation link resets and breaking your
        navigation flow. Experienced programmers understand these details. Think
        AI will debug that for you? I've even managed to spin AI around in
        endless circles, trying to fix a bug, watching it continually add layers
        of code and fixes without truly understanding the context. The problem
        gets more and more messy. People prompt the AI for hours until they
        realize they're just prompting in circles. That's when I got the call.
        Trust me, you don't "get it." You can't just casually do it yourself
        unless you commit to becoming a software engineer like me. Great, now
        you're a software engineer. You can do it yourself. I even have clients
        who do their programming. But realistically, how many teams consist of
        just a single engineer over the long term? You're inevitably going to
        need backup. Meta, X, Microsoft, and Apple employ teams of thousands of
        brilliant people. And that's the next part where the snake oil fails:
        the idea that with AI, everyone will become an army of one. It's simply
        not going to happen. Just face it‚Äîyou don't want to admit it. Put that
        drink down. You need to pay the engineers.
      </p>
      <h2>Interviews, LeetCode, and Reality</h2>
      <p>
        Even Big Tech doesn't like paying engineers. They think they will solve
        the money problem by building a vast walled garden, keeping out all but
        those they believe are the most efficient engineers‚Äîthe ones who can
        solve the most challenging LeetCode problems, tests of algorithmic
        memorization rather than genuine problem-solving skills. LeetCode monkey
        robots. Oh, wait, that was 2 years ago. AI robots will write the code,
        according to Zuck and Nadella. They're not going to hire LeetCode Monkey
        Human Robots. They're going to hire nobody! Brilliant. But Leetcode
        Robot Monkeys and AI Agents Robots aren't engineers who excel at solving
        real-world problems, which are always new and unpredictable. Some are
        far more mundane than LeetCode. But somehow, always more real, original,
        and authentic. Created by original human thought in response to new
        human situations, not algorithms that have been solved a hundred times
        in a textbook somewhere. I have yet to go on an interview with a big
        company where they gave a damn about what I've already built
        successfully for countless clients. They'd rather run down their set
        list of weed-out questions, which they think are relevant from the box
        they are living inside. Their stock is down. Boo hoo. Then there are
        smaller, semi-established companies, where they give you the take-home
        problem. Then, when they get you on a technical screen, they throw the
        addendum to the technical problem up. You can't instantly snap back with
        a solution in 5 seconds? Well, we only want senior engineers here. Never
        mind that solving these problems takes extensive thought, something that
        is hard to assess in real-time. My value has been proven to my clients
        over months and years, let alone minutes. Why don't you ask about what
        I've done for them?¬† So what if I can't spit back a solution to the one
        complex problem you've been tweaking for months? What about the issues
        I've mulled over and solved for my people in the past months? You're
        fooling yourselves. This context is the context in which real engineers
        live. Not LeetCode. Not some contrived situation the interviewer made
        up. It's not something where you can snap back the solution in 5 seconds
        and "look like" you know what you're talking about. You, software
        interviewers, want to convince yourself it's a good proxy, but it is
        not. You are losing track of what's essential. But hey, they sure can
        reverse a binary tree or solve that contrived water levels problem you
        made up to be hard. And they sure can manufacture AI snake oil. That's
        in demand now. I'm sorry for breaking the bad news. It's inevitable; you
        need humans. You will pay. You can come out of your dream world now.
