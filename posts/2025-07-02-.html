**How I Include My Non-Technical, Vibe Coder Clients as Devs in Their Projects (and Save Them Time and Money)**

In today’s world of AI-assisted development, the line between developer and visionary is blurring—and I’ve seen firsthand how non-technical founders can step into a more empowered role, working alongside AI agents to actually ship code.

For years, I’ve worked with founders who bring powerful product ideas but not a line of code. They hire me to bring those ideas to life. But recently, something shifted. With tools like Cursor, Replit, and Windsurf, I’ve started embedding my clients *into the development process* in a surprisingly effective way—and it’s changing how we work together.

Take a look at this conversation I had with a returning client:

He had previously worked with another developer, but I wanted to open up a new angle: “Here’s another angle we should discuss… 2 of my clients use Replit/Windsurf. Cursor is another. They use it alongside me.”

## 🧑‍💻 The Rise of the Vibe Coder Founder

The "vibe coder" founder is someone who:

* Doesn’t write code from scratch
* Knows their product deeply
* Can explain user flows and priorities clearly
* Uses AI tools to participate in development alongside an expert

Instead of being siloed from the engineering process, they now:

* Prompt Cursor or Windsurf with code tasks
* Review and commit AI-generated suggestions
* Send me their diffs or collaborate on GitHub

## ⚖️ A New Collaboration Flow

Here's the model I use:

1. **I own the repo and work in short, functional commits**

   * Think: "fix iOS audio bug" or "implement auth error fallback"
2. **Client uses Replit or Windsurf to view the latest working code**

   * They can run the app in-browser or locally
3. **They submit micro-changes with help from the AI assistant**

   * Example: update the copy, tweak a UI label, adjust colors
4. **I review and integrate their changes**

   * This keeps the codebase consistent and avoids regressions

This has been wildly effective for:

* Validating ideas quickly
* Empowering non-technical founders to iterate
* Keeping costs low by reducing back-and-forth

## 🌟 Why It Works

* **AI acts as a pair programmer for the founder**
* **I'm the quality gate** who ensures commits are safe and useful
* **They learn fast**, and over time their AI usage becomes smarter
* **We share context** on Slack or iMessage, but the real sync is in the repo

## ⚡ Real Examples

* A climate tech founder tweaked their onboarding flow with ChatGPT + Replit and I polished it for production
* An indie app founder rebuilt a screen layout with Windsurf, then I connected it to the Firebase backend
* A first-time founder built their pricing calculator UI entirely in Cursor, and I handled state + animation

## 🚀 Get Started
