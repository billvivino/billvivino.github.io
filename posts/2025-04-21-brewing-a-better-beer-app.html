        Brewing a Better Beer‑Lovers App: A Behind‑the‑Scenes Tour
      </h1>
      <small class="text-muted">April&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2025</small>

      <p class="mt-4">
        If you’ve followed our journey, you know we set out to create a place
        where craft‑beer fans can share pours, swap notes, and keep track of
        their personal bottle collections. Over the past few months we’ve
        shipped dozens of updates—big and small—that push us closer to that
        vision. Here’s a peek at the highlights, told in plain English (no code
        required!).
      </p>

      <h3>1. A Feed That Feels Alive</h3>
      <p>
        The home feed is the heart of the app, so we focused first on making
        posting and reacting effortless—and fun:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>One‑tap photo &amp; tasting‑note posts</strong></li>
        <li>
          <strong>Animated emoji “pours”</strong> with a crisp
          <em>pssst!</em> can‑opening sound
        </li>
        <li>
          Lightning‑fast search and tag suggestions, so your stout or saison is
          easy to find for everyone else
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Your Personal “Cellar”</h3>
      <p>
        Collectors begged for an easy way to remember what’s aging in the back
        of the fridge, so we built a dedicated Cellar tab:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Add beers in seconds</strong>—just snap a label or choose from
          popular breweries
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Smart sorting</strong> by style, date added, or “drink‑by”
          reminders
        </li>
        <li>
          A slick bottle‑rack graphic with realistic shadows that make labels
          pop
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Smoother Onboarding</h3>
      <p>
        A few early testers couldn’t reach the Sign‑Up button on smaller
        phones—yikes! We rebuilt that screen so it scrolls naturally on any
        device and trimmed the number of steps from four to two.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Night‑Friendly Dark Mode</h3>
      <p>
        Many beer‑hunters browse in dim bars, so dark mode matters. Testers told
        us blue links on black were unreadable. We reworked the color palette
        for sharper contrast and tweaked banner highlights so everything stays
        legible, even with Night Shift or low brightness.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Notifications That Land in the Right Place</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing breaks the vibe faster than tapping “Bill commented on your
        post” and ending up somewhere random. We rewired our notification system
        so every tap now dives straight to the conversation that sparked it.
      </p>

      <h3>6. In‑App Messaging, Refreshed</h3>
      <p>
        Early versions cached old chats and refused to show new ones unless you
        force‑quit—annoying! We added swipe‑to‑refresh, smarter caching, and the
        groundwork for push alerts so replies appear the moment they’re sent.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Under‑the‑Hood Tune‑Ups</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Faster load times</strong> after reorganizing our database
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Profile‑picture magic</strong>—change your avatar once and it
          updates everywhere, thanks to a new background task
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reliability checks</strong> on repeat: weeks of multi‑device
          testing to ensure every update sticks
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. What’s Next?</h3>
      <p>
        We’re polishing a tipping feature so you can buy a digital round for the
        beer experts who share killer finds. Expect smoother push notifications,
        curated “pub” feeds, and even more cellar tools soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Craft beer is best enjoyed with friends, and building this app is no
        different. Huge thanks to everyone who posted tasting notes, squashed
        bugs, or simply reminded us the contrast was off at 2&nbsp;a.m. Your
        feedback keeps the taps flowing—cheers! 🍻
