    <h1>How I Include My Non-Technical, Vibe Coder Clients as Devs in Their Projects (and Save Them Time and Money)</h1>

    <p>In today‚Äôs world of AI-assisted development, the line between developer and visionary is blurring‚Äîand I‚Äôve seen firsthand how non-technical founders can step into a more empowered role, working alongside AI agents to actually ship code.</p>

    <p>For years, I‚Äôve worked with founders who bring powerful product ideas but not a line of code. They hire me to bring those ideas to life. But recently, something shifted. With tools like Cursor, Replit, and Windsurf, I‚Äôve started embedding my clients <em>into the development process</em> in a surprisingly effective way‚Äîand it‚Äôs changing how we work together.</p>

    <p>Many of my recent projects now include founder collaboration directly inside the development workflow. For example, some of my clients use Cursor, Replit, or Windsurf to co-edit codebases alongside me. They explore ideas with their agent, test changes, and verify outcomes ‚Äî while I provide the review layer that ensures production-readiness.</p>

    <h2>üßë‚Äçüíª The Rise of the Vibe Coder Founder</h2>

    <p>The "vibe coder" founder is someone who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Doesn‚Äôt write code from scratch</li>
      <li>Knows their product deeply</li>
      <li>Can explain user flows and priorities clearly</li>
      <li>Uses AI tools to participate in development alongside an expert</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instead of being siloed from the engineering process, they now:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prompt Cursor or Windsurf with code tasks</li>
      <li>Review and commit AI-generated suggestions</li>
      <li>Send me their diffs or collaborate on GitHub</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚öñÔ∏è A New Collaboration Flow</h2>

    <p>Here's the model I use:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>I own the repo and work in short, functional commits</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Think: "fix iOS audio bug" or "implement auth error fallback"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Client uses Replit or Windsurf to view the latest working code</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>They can run the app in-browser or locally</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>They submit micro-changes with help from the AI assistant</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Example: update the copy, tweak a UI label, adjust colors</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>I review and integrate their changes</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>This keeps the codebase consistent and avoids regressions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>This has been wildly effective for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Validating ideas quickly</li>
      <li>Empowering non-technical founders to iterate</li>
      <li>Keeping costs low by reducing back-and-forth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üåü Why It Works</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI acts as a pair programmer for the founder</strong></li>
      <li><strong>I'm the quality gate</strong> who ensures commits are safe and useful</li>
      <li><strong>They learn fast</strong>, and over time their AI usage becomes smarter</li>
      <li><strong>We share context</strong> on Slack or iMessage, but the real sync is in the repo</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚ö° Real Examples</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A climate tech founder tweaked their onboarding flow with ChatGPT + Replit and I polished it for production</li>
      <li>An indie app founder rebuilt a screen layout with Windsurf, then I connected it to the Firebase backend</li>
      <li>A first-time founder built their pricing calculator UI entirely in Cursor, and I handled state + animation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üöÄ Get Started</h2>

    <p>Want to co-build with me and AI?<br />
    If you have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A clear idea</li>
      <li>The ability to learn with AI tools like Cursor or Replit</li>
      <li>A desire to stay close to your product</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I‚Äôll help you go from concept to launch.</p>
