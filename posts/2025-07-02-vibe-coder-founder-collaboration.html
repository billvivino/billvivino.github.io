        <h1>
          How I Include My Non-Technical, Vibe Coder Clients as Devs in Their
          Projects (and Save Them Time and Money)
        </h1>

        <p>
          In today’s world of AI-assisted development, the line between
          developer and visionary is blurring—and I’ve seen firsthand how
          non-technical founders can step into a more empowered role, working
          alongside AI agents to actually ship code.
        </p>

        <p>
          For years, I’ve worked with founders who bring powerful product ideas
          but not a line of code. They hire me to bring those ideas to life. But
          recently, something shifted. With tools like Cursor, Replit, and
          Windsurf, I’ve started embedding my clients
          <em>into the development process</em> in a surprisingly effective
          way—and it’s changing how we work together.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many of my recent projects now include founder collaboration directly
          inside the development workflow. For example, some of my clients use
          Cursor, Replit, or Windsurf to co-edit codebases alongside me. They
          explore ideas with their agent, test changes, and verify outcomes —
          while I provide the review layer that ensures production-readiness.
        </p>

        <h2>🧑‍💻 The Rise of the Vibe Coder Founder</h2>

        <p>The "vibe coder" founder is someone who:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Doesn’t write code from scratch</li>
          <li>Knows their product deeply</li>
          <li>Can explain user flows and priorities clearly</li>
          <li>
            Uses AI tools to participate in development alongside an expert
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Instead of being siloed from the engineering process, they now:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prompt Cursor or Windsurf with code tasks</li>
          <li>Review and commit AI-generated suggestions</li>
          <li>Send me their diffs or collaborate on GitHub</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>⚖️ A New Collaboration Flow</h2>

        <p>Here's the model I use:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong
              >I own the repo and work in short, functional commits</strong
            >
            <ul>
              <li>
                Think: "fix iOS audio bug" or "implement auth error fallback"
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Client uses Replit or Windsurf to view the latest working
              code</strong
            >
            <ul>
              <li>They can run the app in-browser or locally</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >They submit micro-changes with help from the AI assistant</strong
            >
            <ul>
              <li>Example: update the copy, tweak a UI label, adjust colors</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>I review and integrate their changes</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>This keeps the codebase consistent and avoids regressions</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>This has been wildly effective for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Validating ideas quickly</li>
          <li>Empowering non-technical founders to iterate</li>
          <li>Keeping costs low by reducing back-and-forth</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🌟 Why It Works</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI acts as a pair programmer for the founder</strong></li>
          <li>
            <strong>I'm the quality gate</strong> who ensures commits are safe
            and useful
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>They learn fast</strong>, and over time their AI usage
            becomes smarter
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We share context</strong> on Slack or iMessage, but the real
            sync is in the repo
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>⚡ Real Examples</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A climate tech founder tweaked their onboarding flow with ChatGPT +
            Replit and I polished it for production
          </li>
          <li>
            An indie app founder rebuilt a screen layout with Windsurf, then I
            connected it to the Firebase backend
          </li>
          <li>
            A first-time founder built their pricing calculator UI entirely in
            Cursor, and I handled state + animation
          </li>
        </ul>
