    <p>
      <em>
        Is there a reason this product deserves to exist beyond execution quality?
      </em>
    </p>

    <div class="callout-box">
      <strong>Purpose:</strong>
      This tool exists to stop teams from building well-executed products that
      still have no durable reason to win.
    </div>

    <h2>Why This Question Comes First</h2>

    <p>
      Most failed products do not fail because they were badly built.
      They fail because they were <em>easy to replicate</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Execution quality is table stakes.
      If your only advantage is “we’ll build it better,” you are betting against
      time, capital, and copycats.
    </p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <strong>Warning:</strong>
      If this tool feels uncomfortable, that’s the point.
      It’s much cheaper to answer these questions now than after a rewrite.
    </div>

    <h2>The Core Diagnostic</h2>

    <div class="question-box">
      <h3>1. What gets harder as this product scales?</h3>
      <p>
        If nothing becomes harder with scale, competitors get stronger as you grow.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data accumulation</li>
        <li>Workflow complexity</li>
        <li>Operational depth</li>
        <li>Trust or compliance requirements</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <h3>2. What improves with usage that competitors cannot instantly copy?</h3>
      <p>
        Usage-based improvement is one of the few real moats.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Proprietary data</li>
        <li>Learning effects</li>
        <li>Embedded process knowledge</li>
        <li>Network or organizational lock-in</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <h3>3. If a well-funded team cloned this tomorrow, what would they still lack?</h3>
      <p>
        Assume UI, features, and pricing are copied perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        What cannot be bought or rushed?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <h3>4. Does adoption require users to change how they already work?</h3>
      <p>
        Products embedded into real workflows are harder to displace.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daily operational dependency</li>
        <li>Regulatory or audit implications</li>
        <li>Process reconfiguration</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <h3>5. Is the founder the moat right now?</h3>
      <p>
        Early-stage moats are often personal.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unique access</li>
        <li>Insider knowledge</li>
        <li>Operational pain personally lived</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is valid — but only temporarily.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Interpreting the Result</h2>

    <p>
      After answering honestly, your product usually falls into one of these:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Structural moat</strong> – Hard to replicate even with money</li>
      <li><strong>Workflow moat</strong> – Embedded in how work actually happens</li>
      <li><strong>Data moat</strong> – Improves uniquely with use</li>
      <li><strong>Distribution moat</strong> – Access others cannot buy</li>
      <li><strong>No moat yet</strong> – Valid for MVP, dangerous for scale</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-box">
      <strong>Important:</strong>
      “No moat yet” does not mean “do not build.”
      It means you are buying learning, not durability.
    </div>

    <h2>What This Tool Is Not</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>It is not a VC pitch filter</li>
      <li>It is not a feature checklist</li>
      <li>It does not guarantee success</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It exists to prevent teams from confusing
      execution quality with inevitability.
    </p>

    <h2>When to Use This</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Before hiring developers</li>
      <li>Before raising money</li>
      <li>Before committing to a rewrite</li>
      <li>When a project “feels good” but momentum is unclear</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>

    <p>
      Great software can still lose.
      Not because it was poorly built,
      but because it had no structural reason to win.
    </p>

    <p>
      This question doesn’t slow you down.
      It saves you from building the wrong thing efficiently.
    </p>
