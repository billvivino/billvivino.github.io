    <h1>The MVP Tech Stack: How to Build Fast, Iterate Faster</h1>

    <p>
      When you're launching a new product, speed matters. You want to get
      your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) out the door quickly, learn from
      real users, and iterate without wasting time or money.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choosing the right tech stack can make or break this process. Too
      complex, and you'll get bogged down in development. Too simple, and
      you might hit limits that slow you down later.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Principles for an MVP Tech Stack</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed over perfection:</strong> Opt for tools that let you
        build quickly, even if they're not the most scalable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Your stack should accommodate changes
        as you learn what users want.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Avoid expensive licenses or
        infrastructure early on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Familiarity:</strong> Use technologies you or your team
        already know to reduce ramp-up time.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recommended Technologies</h2>

    <h3>Frontend</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>React:</strong> A popular JavaScript library for building
        user interfaces quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tailwind CSS:</strong> Utility-first CSS framework for rapid
        styling without leaving your HTML.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vite:</strong> A fast build tool that improves development
        experience with instant reloads.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mobile</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android):</strong> This is my
        preferred mobile stack. Native development gives you full access to
        the OS with no runtime overhead, which is critical for performance,
        battery, and native integrations. With the rise of AI-assisted
        development, translating structure and logic between Swift and
        Kotlin has become much faster, making parallel native builds more
        efficient and accessible—even for solo developers or small teams.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>React Native (with Expo):</strong> Still a strong option for
        startups needing a shared codebase across platforms. Best suited for
        quick launches where ultra-native polish is less critical.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note: There are ongoing discussions about Swift-compatible frameworks
      for Android, which could eventually simplify native cross-platform
      development even further.
    </p>

    <h3>Backend</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Node.js with Express:</strong> Lightweight and flexible
        server framework.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Firebase:</strong> Backend-as-a-Service that handles
        authentication, database, and hosting without server management.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supabase:</strong> An open-source alternative to Firebase
        with Postgres database support.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Database</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> Reliable relational database,
        especially if using Supabase.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Firestore:</strong> NoSQL document database from Firebase
        for flexible data models.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deployment & Hosting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Vercel or Netlify:</strong> Simplified deployment platforms
        with continuous integration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Firebase Hosting:</strong> Fast and secure static hosting
        with CDN.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

    <p>A common MVP stack might look like this:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>React + Tailwind CSS for frontend UI</li>
      <li>Firebase for backend services and hosting</li>
      <li>Vercel for deployment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This combination lets you focus on building features instead of
      infrastructure. Plus, it scales well enough for early growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Tips</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Keep your architecture simple and modular.</li>
      <li>Automate deployments and testing where possible.</li>
      <li>Gather user feedback early and often to guide development.</li>
      <li>Be prepared to pivot your stack as your product evolves.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The right MVP tech stack empowers you to ship fast, learn faster, and
      build something users love.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Happy building!</strong></p>
