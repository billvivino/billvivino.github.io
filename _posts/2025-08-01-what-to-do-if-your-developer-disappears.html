    <p>
      Your app was almost done. Then the developer stopped responding. No
      handoff. No documentation. Just silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re not alone—and you're not stuck. This guide shows you how to get
      control, preserve your progress, and reboot your project with minimal
      loss.
    </p>

    <h2>🚨 First, a Cautionary Tale</h2>
    <p>
      A founder hired a developer overseas to build a social app. Payments
      were made, screenshots looked promising, and they were told “it’s
      launching next week.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the emails stopped. No GitHub access. No credentials. No way to
      run the code. The app was gone—and they had nothing to show for six
      months of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to me to rebuild it from scratch. That should never have
      happened.
    </p>

    <h2>✅ Step 1: Secure the Source Code — Today</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Do this even if the dev is still active. Don’t wait.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask for GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) access now</li>
      <li>Clone the repo or download a ZIP copy</li>
      <li>Push it to your own GitHub org or backup folder</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      📌
      <strong
        >If you don’t have the source code, you don’t own your app.
        Period.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <h2>🔑 Step 2: Take Control of Your Credentials</h2>
    <p>Make sure <strong>you</strong> own the keys to the kingdom:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>App Store / Google Play developer accounts</li>
      <li>Firebase, AWS, Vercel, or hosting platforms</li>
      <li>Stripe, Twilio, SendGrid, etc.</li>
      <li>DNS/domain registration</li>
      <li>Any CI/CD or deployment pipeline</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      🛑 <strong>Warning:</strong> If the developer owns your Firebase or
      Stripe account, they can shut you down or walk away with your users’
      data.
    </p>

    <h2>🧾 Step 3: Download Everything</h2>
    <p>Before they disappear:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Figma files, PDFs, Loom walkthroughs</li>
      <li>Contracts or invoices</li>
      <li>Screenshots, mocks, or diagrams</li>
      <li>Video screen recordings of walkthroughs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Even if you <em>don’t</em> know how to use it, save it. A future
      developer can.
    </p>

    <h2>🔐 Step 4: Change the Passwords If Needed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Revoke GitHub permissions</li>
      <li>Change Firebase, hosting, and domain passwords</li>
      <li>Disable access tokens or SSH keys</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛠 Step 5: Get a Developer to Audit the Codebase</h2>
    <p>If you have a code folder but don’t know what’s in it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask a trusted dev (like me) to assess what’s usable</li>
      <li>Determine whether it's salvageable or needs a full rewrite</li>
      <li>
        Don’t assume a build folder or testflight binary = source code
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧭 Step 6: Reboot With a Transparent Dev</h2>
    <p>Here’s how I protect my clients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You get access to GitHub from day 1</li>
      <li>You get weekly updates and a live staging link</li>
      <li>All accounts are created under your name</li>
      <li>You own everything—forever</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Bonus: Red Flags Your Dev Might Ghost You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>They avoid giving GitHub access</li>
      <li>They only send builds, not source code</li>
      <li>They don’t document anything</li>
      <li>They keep pushing deadlines without showing commits</li>
      <li>They won’t sign a contract or NDA</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔚 Final Word</h2>
    <p>
      If your dev ghosts you without handing over the code, you’re starting
      from zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t wait for that moment. Lock down your assets
      <strong>today</strong>—even if everything seems fine.
