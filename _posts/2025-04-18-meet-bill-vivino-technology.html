  <h3 class="mt-4">Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Hi! My name is Bill Vivino, and I'd like to help you develop your
    project from its initial ideas to completion. With extensive experience
    in Unity, mobile development, and API integrations, I'm here to turn
    your vision into reality.
  </p>

  <h3>My Professional Journey</h3>
  <p>
    I currently work as a contract Unity and C# developer on an interactive
    app for the NASA Visitor Center. Additionally, I co‑founded an iOS game
    startup with one of my clients, debuting our first app on the App Store.
    Beyond these roles, I maintain several freelance engagements, developing
    high‑quality mobile applications tailored to the needs of small‑sized
    businesses.
  </p>

  <h3>Educational Background</h3>
  <p>
    I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Rutgers
    University. I recently began my journey as a freelance contract software
    developer, driven by a renewed passion for creating impactful digital
    experiences.
  </p>

  <h3>Recent Projects and Experience</h3>
  <p>
    My comeback journey started by developing an app tailored specifically
    for craft beer enthusiasts. I then successfully ported a Unity‑based
    Lego game from PC to iOS. These initial projects opened doors, leading
    me to collaborate with multiple clients on Upwork, expanding my
    portfolio, and refining my skills further.
  </p>

  <p>
    My substantial experience in Unity/C# game development, combined with
    extensive iOS app development skills, directly contributed to my current
    role working with AMC NASA. I'm continuously seeking opportunities to
    expand my horizons and deliver high‑quality solutions tailored to my
    clients' needs.
  </p>

  <h3>My Skills and Expertise</h3>
  <p>
    Throughout my career, I've gained significant experience working with
    popular APIs and frameworks, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>SwiftUI &amp; UIKit:</strong> Crafting intuitive, responsive,
      and beautiful user interfaces for iOS apps.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Firebase SDK:</strong> Implementing secure, scalable backend
      solutions for mobile apps.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>StoreKit API:</strong> Navigating Apple's complex purchasing
      processes and in‑app transactions seamlessly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Additionally, I have extensive firsthand experience guiding apps through
    Apple's rigorous App Store review process. My expertise ensures your
    apps smoothly transition from beta (using Apple's TestFlight) into live
    production in a timely and efficient manner.
  </p>

  <h3>Let's Work Together</h3>
  <p>
    I'm committed to helping your project succeed and would love the
    opportunity to learn more about your goals. Please feel free to explore
    my

    projects on the App Store and beta versions available via TestFlight.
