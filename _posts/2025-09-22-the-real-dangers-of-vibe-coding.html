      What happens when AI powered vibe coding goes wrong and how to clean
      it up. The short version: speed without guardrails creates fragile
      code, security holes, and runaway costs. The fix is a cleanup
      specialist who hardens what you already built so it can actually ship.
    </p>

    <h2>Meet Chris, the vibe coder</h2>
    <p>
      Chris is not a traditional developer. He is an IT and web guy with
      tons of ideas but no steady engineering bench. Freelancers ghost,
      prototypes stall, and launches slip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then AI tooling shows up: Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, Replit, Windsurf, v0
      by Vercel, GitHub Copilot, Base44, Tempo Labs, Aider. Suddenly he can
      build solo with prompts and make real progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It feels magical at first. In a week Chris ships more than he did in
      years. Then the cracks appear.
    </p>

    <h2>The reality behind the vibe</h2>
    <h3>Bug whack a mole</h3>
    <p>
      Fix one error and two more pop up. Functions overwrite each other with
      no warnings.
    </p>

    <h3>Security nightmares</h3>
    <p>
      Alerts start firing, patches break databases, backups fail, and
      restores are a gamble.
    </p>

    <h3>API credit drain</h3>
    <p>
      Token usage spikes, surprise bills hit, and open endpoints let
      strangers burn through credits.
    </p>

    <h3>Production anxiety</h3>
    <p>
      Will this ever launch to real users or stay stuck in the sandbox
      forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the surface the project hides unoptimized code, fragile
      dependencies, and exposed secrets. The magic is skin deep.

    <h2>Enter the cleanup specialist</h2>
    <p>
      Think of it like hiring a contractor after a DIY home build. The walls
      look fine, but the wiring sparks and the plumbing leaks. You need
      someone to make it safe, solid, and livable.
    </p>
    <ul class="custom-checklist">
      <li>Refactor fragile code so it is stable.</li>
      <li>Close security holes before they become breaches.</li>
      <li>Optimize API usage so credits and tokens do not bleed out.</li>
      <li>Add guardrails so new features do not overwrite old wins.</li>
      <li>Ship with backups, CI/CD, and monitoring in place.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The bigger picture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Enterprises see vibe coded prototypes that compliance will not
        approve.
      </li>
      <li>Startups burn investor dollars debugging AI written messes.</li>
      <li>
        Solo builders wake up to projects that will not compile, scale, or
        stay online.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That is why the market is buzzing about cleanup developers: real
      engineers who clean up after AI.

    <h2>Why Bill Vivino Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Bill ships production grade systems for teams like NASA, IFS Filter,
      and 1OR. He knows mobile, web, cloud, and AI and turns half finished
      experiments into stable, secure applications.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>4.0 GPA from Rutgers</li>
      <li>
        Full stack execution across iOS, Android, Web, APIs, and Cloud
      </li>
      <li>Security and compliance mindset with SSO and common standards</li>
      <li>Delivery history with known names</li>
      <li>Five star Upwork rating</li>
      <li>Most important: ships production systems, not demos</li>
    </ul>
