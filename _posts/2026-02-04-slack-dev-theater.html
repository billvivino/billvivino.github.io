    <p><em>How a well-intentioned founder relationship quietly turned into a pattern — and why I built a detector for it.</em></p>

    <div class="tldr-box">
      <strong>TLDR:</strong>
      Slack Dev Theater happens when discussion replaces ownership.  
      The team feels productive, aligned, and busy — but execution slows or stops.
      This isn’t a people problem. It’s a structural one.
    </div>

    <h2>How This Pattern Shows Up</h2>

    <p>
      This article isn’t about one bad client or one bad founder.
      It’s about a pattern I’ve now seen enough times that I can recognize it early.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most recent version of it happened with a founder I was working with.
      Smart. Curious. Thoughtful. Deeply engaged.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slack was always active.
      Threads were long.
      Ideas were interesting.
      Everyone was collaborating.
    </p>

    <p>
      And yet — very little shipped.
    </p>

    <h2>The Early Signals</h2>

    <p>At first, nothing feels wrong.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Questions are thoughtful</li>
      <li>Edge cases are explored</li>
      <li>Alternatives are discussed</li>
      <li>Everyone wants to “get it right”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      But slowly, execution begins to defer to discussion.
      Decisions get postponed.
      Ownership becomes fuzzy.
    </p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      “Let’s talk through this one more time.”  
      “I just want to make sure we’re aligned.”  
      “What if we did it this other way?”
    </div>

    <p>
      None of these are unreasonable in isolation.
      Together, they form a trap.
    </p>

    <h2>The Core Problem Isn’t Slack</h2>

    <p>
      Slack is just the medium.
      The real issue is what happens when:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>No one is clearly empowered to decide</li>
      <li>Every decision invites group consensus</li>
      <li>Discussion becomes the work</li>
      <li>Shipping requires agreement, not ownership</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I call this <strong>Slack Dev Theater</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It looks like productivity.
      It feels collaborative.
      But it quietly replaces forward motion.
    </p>

    <h2>What Made This One Different</h2>

    <p>
      With this founder, the pattern became obvious when the same topics resurfaced —
      architecture choices, scope boundaries, implementation details —
      even after they’d already been discussed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system didn’t lack intelligence.
      It lacked <strong>decision finality</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At some point, the work shifted from building a system
      to endlessly justifying why it should be built a certain way.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Is So Common With Founders</h2>

    <p>
      Founders are trained to explore uncertainty.
      Engineers are trained to collapse it.
    </p>

    <p>
      When those two instincts aren’t clearly separated by role and authority,
      you get a tug-of-war:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The founder keeps exploring</li>
      <li>The engineer keeps trying to converge</li>
      <li>Neither feels fully satisfied</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Over time, this creates exhaustion on both sides.
    </p>

    <h2>Why “More Alignment” Makes It Worse</h2>

    <p>
      The instinctive fix is usually:
    </p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      “Let’s align more.”  
      “Let’s talk it through again.”  
      “Let’s get everyone’s input.”
    </div>

    <p>
      But alignment does not substitute for ownership.
      In fact, excessive alignment often hides the absence of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Teams don’t stall because they lack intelligence.
      They stall because no one is allowed to decide and move on.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Built the Slack Dev Theater Detector</h2>

    <p>
      After seeing this pattern enough times,
      I realized I could diagnose it structurally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not by judging people.
      Not by blaming effort.
      But by looking at signals:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>How many channels per feature</li>
      <li>How long threads get</li>
      <li>How often decisions are documented</li>
      <li>How frequently work ships without debate</li>
      <li>How many alignment meetings exist</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That became the <strong>Slack Dev Theater Detector</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>What Actually Fixes This</h2>

    <p>
      The solution is not better tools.
      It’s not fewer messages.
      It’s not smarter people.
    </p>

    <p>
      The solution is:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clear decision ownership</li>
      <li>Explicit authority boundaries</li>
      <li>Acceptance that some decisions are irreversible</li>
      <li>A bias toward shipping over discussing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Good teams talk.
      Great teams decide.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>

    <p>
      Slack Dev Theater doesn’t mean anyone is failing.
      It means the system is misconfigured.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this story feels familiar, it’s because it’s common —
      especially in early-stage products where roles blur.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fix isn’t more collaboration.
      It’s clearer ownership.
    </p>

    <p>
      And once you see it, you can’t unsee it.
    </p>
