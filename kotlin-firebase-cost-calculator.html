    <h2>What Is a Firebase Cost Calculator and Why Should You Use One?</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re building an Android app with Firebase in 2026, estimating your
      monthly Firebase costs is critical. Firebase pricing is usage-based, and
      costs can increase quickly as your app scales. This Firebase Cost
      Calculator is designed for developers using the Firebase Blaze Plan. It
      estimates real-world Firebase costs based on actual usage patterns, not
      guesses.
    </p>
    <h3>✅ What Can This Firebase Cost Calculator Estimate in 2026?</h3>
    <p>This calculator estimates monthly Firebase costs for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud Firestore reads/writes/deletes</li>
      <li>Cloud Storage GB used</li>
      <li>Data transfer bandwidth</li>
      <li>Function invocations</li>
      <li>Firebase Hosting usage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It then gives you a detailed cost breakdown based on the latest Google
      Cloud pricing. Whether you’re launching a Kotlin + Firebase MVP or scaling
      a production app, this tool helps you predict costs across Firebase
      services.
    </p>
    <h3>✅ Firebase Pricing in 2026: What Drives Costs the Most?</h3>
    <p>Firebase costs are most commonly driven by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>High-volume Firestore reads and real-time listeners</li>
      <li>Frequent Cloud Functions invocations</li>
      <li>Outbound network bandwidth</li>
      <li>Large file storage in Firebase Cloud Storage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Many apps remain inexpensive during MVP stages but see rapid cost growth
      once daily active users increase. This is why using a Firebase cost
      estimator before launch is essential.
    </p>
    <h3>🔎 Firebase Cost Examples</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Small MVP:</b>
      A lightweight app using Firebase Authentication, limited Firestore reads,
      and minimal storage may stay within the free tier or cost under $10/month.
      <br />
      <b>Growing App:</b>
      Apps with thousands of daily users, real-time updates, and moderate Cloud
      Functions usage often range between $50–$300/month.
      <br />
      <b>Production App:</b>
      High-traffic apps with heavy Firestore usage, push notifications, and
      background processing can exceed $1,000/month without optimization.
    </p>
    <h3>🔎 How Accurate Is This Firebase Cost Calculator?</h3>
    <p>
      This calculator provides realistic estimates based on Firebase’s published
      2026 pricing. Actual costs depend on usage patterns, optimization, and
      query design. Always monitor real usage in the Firebase Console and set
      billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>💡 Pro tip:</strong> Firebase offers a generous free tier. If your
      app stays within those limits, your cost might be $0/month — but the
      moment you scale, having an estimator like this becomes essential.
    </p>
    <h3>💬 Common Questions</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Is Firebase free in 2026?</strong> Yes — Firebase has a free tier
      called the Spark Plan. But for production apps or scaling, you’ll need the
      Blaze Plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Is Firebase expensive?</strong> It depends on your usage. Costs
      can rise with real-time listeners, large file storage, or high traffic,
      which is why estimating beforehand is smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Where do I check actual Firebase costs?</strong> In your Firebase
      console: go to Project Settings → Usage and Billing. For historical cost
      data, head to the linked Google Cloud Console.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Firebase Cost Calculator is intended for planning and estimation. For
      production apps, cost optimization strategies such as query batching,
      index tuning, and function throttling can significantly reduce monthly
      Firebase bills.
